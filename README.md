**TLDR**: See screenshots at the [blog](http://cityilluminated.com/?p=101&preview=true) and check out the [sample app](https://dd-test.herokuapp.com/map/index.html).

A Data Dictionary (or [Data Inventory](http://labs.centerforgov.org/data-governance/data-inventory/)) is one of the requirements for the Bloomberg [What Works Cities](https://whatworkscities.bloomberg.org/certification/).    
While you can just use a spreadsheet, it can be helpful to visualize the relationships between your data, hence this project.
